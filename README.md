A GIT based password manager.

### What's the idea?

The user maintains a private git repository which will store his encrypted passwords.
The terminal CLI will enable him to easily view these passwords and update them as and when necessary.

2. GIT integration ✔
3. Setup new password directory ✔
4. Setup existing git directory 🚧 - **Yet to test**
5. Add a new entry ❌
6. List passwords from git directory 🚧 - **Yet to test**

Found a blocker:
- When encrypting the domain to turn it into the filename, the encrypted filename can contain `/` character making it an invalid file name.

Potential solution:
- Use a random alphanumberic string for the filename.
- Add the domain details in the file itself.
